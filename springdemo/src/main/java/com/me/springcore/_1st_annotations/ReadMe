Spring Core Annotations:
	@Configuration:
		If this annotation will be putted on top of a class, determines that its class is configuration class.	
	
	@Component
		This annotation will be putted on top of classes which programmer want to give over object initializing and its management to spring container.
		
	@ComponentScan(basePackages = "com.me")
		This annotation will be putted on top of a Configuration class and determines that configuration class where search for components	
	
	========================================================================================
	@Bean(name = "optionalName")
		It is 2 ways for defining beans for container,
			1st way is using @Component annotation
			2nd way is using @Bean annotation on top of own defined method that on it a new object make
    @Scope(value = "singleton")
		This annotation tells to spring container any times that programmer want new object, container must give same primary object, no more.
		For getting another object from current type, must make another container with new key word.
	@Scope(value = "prototype")
		This annotation tells to spring container any times that programmer want new object, you make new object without making new container.
	========================================================================================	
	@Autowired
	@Qualifier(value = "")
	@Value(value = "")

	Lazy and Eager Strategy bean:
		This strategy tells to spring container when creating object, in start upping project or any time programmer require?
		@Lazy:
			It is annotation for describing bean producing to spring container. This annotation uses for spring components that determines with @Component
			on top of them
		@Lazy(value = false):
			This is default state for this annotation, and tells to spring container that start upping time, make all beans
		@Lazy(value = true):
			If value set true, spring container will not make bean, till programmer want
